# Usage:
# $:./rax-nimbus-install.sh

# Overview:
# Install nimbus and set it up according to the installation methods described
# in the Support WIKI. This tool was created to allow for the rapid installation
# of nimbus on Rackspace Dedicated servers. To use the script, upload the
# "nimbus-installer.tar.gz" file to the "/tmp" directory then execute the script
# locally.

# Notes:
# This script makes the assumption that the server is using a dedicated publicly
# routable IP address. The script attempts to use "icanhazip.com" to retrieve the
# IP address. This is used in the nimbus setup script when registering the agent.
# The script also assumes that the "/root/.rackspace/" was setup correctly
# and contains the following files: customer_number, server_number, datacenter.
# The last action of this script is to change the run level of nimbus. The script
# will attempt to set it to "defaults 99" when ubuntu and "checkconfig on" when
# RHEL. All of the run levels will be overridden IF LSB headers are found in the
# Provided NIMBUS init script.
